# Apoptosis
Multi-label
Additional we built a new multi-label protein dataset, the creation processcan be describe as follows steps: (i) select "Subcellular location [CC]" in the Term from the UniProt database (Release 2019-08), and enter keywords with apoptosis function in the sub Term，respectively, such as “cytoplasmic proteins”. (ii) the protein sequence is incomplete and the length less-than 50 are exclude. (iii) Select Review, only save the sequences with exact location information and low redundancy, which have been documented and verified scientifically. (iv) For the subcellular location annotation with vague notes such as ‘by similarity’, ’possible’ were eliminate. (v) All sequence includes ambiguous express such as “U”, “O”, “J” and “X” were discarded. Through the above steps, there are only 3266 data conformed to its rules, Finally, adopted the CD-HIT program to filtered the homologous of protein sequence.
